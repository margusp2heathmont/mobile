## Important questions (31.08.2022)

1. Why?
2. How?
3. What?
4. When?

## How to learn

Use Google and Youtube search engines. Learn to search for answers for your questions. 

Try: 
1. https://www.google.com/?q=how%20to%20create%20mobile%20applications
2. https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+create+mobile+applications

Usually Youtube provides very good answers, so step by step, you get smarter, for what to search for.

(Ok, we do some tasks in class, but Youtube is much smarter, than your teacher.)
